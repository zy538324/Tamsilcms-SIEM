# Vulnerability Intelligence Service (MVP-10)

Scope: Contextual vulnerability detection, exposure analysis, and risk scoring.

Responsibilities:
- Ingest software, patch, configuration, and behavioural context.
- Map CVEs and non-CVE weaknesses to assets.
- Produce explainable exposure and risk outcomes.
- Track lifecycle transitions and risk acceptance evidence.

Additional context inputs:
- CVE feed health metadata (status and last updated timestamps).
- Behavioural signal direction (supports or contradicts exploit assumptions).
- Superseded patch records to avoid false assurance.

Failure-mode coverage:
- Feed errors or delays reduce confidence to avoid blind escalation.
- Mixed behavioural signals default to contradicted outcomes.
- Disabled or unreachable services are capped to informational severity.
