"""Start all development services concurrently (convenience wrapper).

This imports the existing `run_services` developer runner and extends its
`SERVICES` map with all microservices in this repository (excluding the agent).

Usage:
  python run_all_services.py
  python run_all_services.py --no-reload

Notes:
- Ports are chosen to avoid collisions with the default `run_services` set.
